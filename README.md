# ProgrammingAssessment Description
WeatherWise is a Python-based system that analyzes weather data using API and NLP, with visualizations and basic chatbot features.
# Code Explination 
The **WeatherWise: Intelligent Weather Analysis & Advisory System** is a Python-based application designed to fetch, analyze, and visualize weather data using real-time API integration and natural language processing (NLP). It installs and imports libraries such as `requests`, `matplotlib`, `spacy`, and `pyinputplus`, leveraging them to interact with a free weather API (`wttr.in`), handle user input, and parse text-based queries. The spaCy English model enhances the chatbot-like interaction, allowing users to input weather-related questions in natural language. The core functionality revolves around the `get_weather_data` function, which retrieves weather data based on city names and structures it for both current conditions and multi-day forecasts, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times. Visualizations are generated to represent weather trends and make the data more interpretable for users.

However, the system has some limitations. The free API used does not support coordinate-based queries, meaning it cannot retrieve weather data using latitude and longitude, which restricts the ability to provide precise, location-specific forecasts. Additionally, while the NLP functionality offers an intelligent interface, it lacks the ability to extract detailed query context and geographic data in real time. This shortcoming reduces the effectiveness of the chatbot in interpreting vague or complex user queries. Moreover, the API often fails to deliver data for narrowly defined or small localities, which can limit the system's usefulness for users in rural or lesser-known areas. Despite these constraints, WeatherWise remains a functional prototype that showcases the integration of data science and NLP for intelligent weather advisory services.
